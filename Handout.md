# Intro to C Programming

# Summary

In this session, we will look at the basics of the C programming language. C is a language that dates back to 1972. Since its inception, C's novel syntax has influenced many newer languages like Java, C#, JavaScript, and Python. We will look at how the syntax compares to Java and introduce concepts that are important to programming in C.

# Prerequisites

As we will not be writing code during the workshop, you do not need to set anything up ahead of time. However, if you would like to mess around with C or run the code samples given, you can follow these instructions to get set up.

1. The easiest way to write C is to use a Linux computer, as it already has the necessary tools installed. Luckily, you can SSH into `data.cs.purdue.edu` to follow along and write C code.
    - If you would like to use a graphical editor, you can look into installing the [Remote - SSH extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) for Visual Studio Code.
    - If you would rather develop completely on your personal computer, you should either have a Mac or install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (or another Linux emulator) on Windows.
2. If using WSL on Windows, make sure the following tools are installed:
    - gcc
        - `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gcc`
    - make
        - `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y make`
